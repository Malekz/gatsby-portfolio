          I am Malek Zarzour, a frontend developer based in Dinslaken, Germany.
          I am an advocate for web performance and accessibility as well as a
          JAMstack enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use Javascript because of its versatility and ongoing evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made a career change in 2018 from B.A in English Language and
          Literature into web development.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a 12 month intensive Web Development Bootcamp in an
          international and multicultural environment institute, i've gained the
          most demanded skills taught in the industry and i believe i have what
          it takes to start my career as a frontend developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my learning experience in Digital Career Institute, I have
          learned that "writing clean code" and functions all day long in front
          of a black screen is not the most important skill to have.
        </p>
        <p>Being a human and good communicator is even more important.</p>

          More about me
        </Styled.h2>
        <p>I am a husband and father of two.</p>
        <p>
          Born in Syria, raised in Dubai, lived two years in Istanbul, and now
          settled in beautiful Dinslaken, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like all kinds of sports, but Tennis and Table-tennis is my
          main-sport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooking? I've been told that i got the gift. I mainly cook
          middle-eastern cuisines. Who knows! you might taste my food one day.
