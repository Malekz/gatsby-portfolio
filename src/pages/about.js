          I am Malek Zarzour, a frontend developer based in Dinslaken, Germany.
          I am an advocate for web performance and accessibility as well as a
          JAMstack enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use Javascript because of its versatility and ongoing evolution.

        <p>I use Javascript</p>
        <p>
          I made a career change in 2018 from B.A in English Language and
          Literature into web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, it all started in the summer of 2017 when I attended an
          event in Trivagoâ€™s headquarter office in Dusseldorf. There was that
          guy who spoke for 30 minutes about how he become a web developer in
          less than a year and now he is working for Trivago in a product used
          by millions of people around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>He ended his speech by saying the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          I have never been satisfied and fulfilled personally and
          professionally as I am today .. the web is the future
        </blockquote>

        <p>His story sold me.</p>
        <p>
          After a 12 month intensive Web Development Bootcamp in an
          international and multicultural environment institute, i've gained the
          most demanded skills taught in the industry and i believe i have what
          it takes to start my career as a frontend developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my learning experience in Digital Career Institute, I have
          learned that "writing clean code" and functions all day long in front
          of a black screen is not the most important skill to have.
        </p>
        <p>Being a human and good communicator is even more important.</p>
