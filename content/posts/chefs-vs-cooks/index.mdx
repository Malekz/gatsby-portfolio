excerpt: Are you a chef or a cook web developer. The difference is vast.
---

Many web developers, sometimes without knowing it, seek to be “cooks” (through their actions).

Other Web developers; and there are a lot fewer of these, seek to be “chefs.”

Their actions (and beliefs) are very different.

#### I'll explain by way of an analogy, then tie the idea back to our world:

When you go to a restaurant: there are two types of people who cook the food that diners order.

One type typically works in Michelin star establishments, like the Aviary in Chicago, or Gordon Ramsay in London, or the Mirazur in Menton, France.

They're called chefs.

The other type are cooks.

You'll find them in places like McDonald's, Wendy's, and Chili's Grill & Bar. Even your local "pretty good" restaurant.

The difference between the two is vast, of course.

The chef understands the interactions between ingredients and flavors at such a deep base level; he or she can reassemble them into "art."

Something that tastes out of this world.

An experience that diners will book a year in advance for. Sometimes even longer in the case of elBulli in Catalonia, Spain, run by chef Ferran Adrià.

The cook, in contrast, can only see his world as recipes. Creations and ideas from others.

The cook starts from a recipe, and tweaks and fiddles from there.

Or if the restaurant is McDonald's: follow the damn recipe to a tee. No thinking for yourself. Just follow the tried-and-tested (prescribed) system.

I'm going to be quick to point out that the world needs BOTH types of people.

Someone new, young, and hungry; seeking to one day become a Michelin star chef, doesn't cut their teeth in a McDonald's or a Chili's Grill & Bar.

They'll start washing dishes in the restaurant they one day seek to emulate, watching their idol operate, sucking it all in like a sponge, asking questions, taking notes, thinking deeply.

To a person who sees themselves as a chef-in-waiting; they do it for the calling because they _need_ to create world-class food and serve it to people who care about the experience and joy of eating.

They don't do it because it's just a job.

A cook, in contrast, rarely follows this path.

Their starting point is working in ordinary restaurants learning from ordinary cooks.

For the cook, it's almost always a job; a means to an end.

### In tech, the web development we do; the dynamic is similar (if not the same).\*\*

The cook web-developers seeks out "recipes" to copy or clone.

Because why reinvent the goddam wheel, right?

They just follow the Tutorials to the a tea, without thinking outside the box.

Without thinking to things differently even without any framework.

Nothing wrong with this; nothing at all.

It does the job.

The Chef Developers, having cut their teeth, not by blindly following recipe after recipe, but by learning about “Atoms and components” to create the best user experiences. Their are playing the long-game to get where they seek to go.

### TAKE AWAY (excuse the pun)

The **starting point** is deciding **who you are and who you want to serve.**
